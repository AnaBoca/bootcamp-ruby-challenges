# University of Arizona Online Coding Boot Camp Challenges

In these challenges, students worked with complex data structures to solidify object-oriented programming skills -- 
laying the foundation for a software engineering career. The challenges also gave students rigorous preparation 
needed for any technical interview.



## [ðŸ§® Quizzes #1 and #2](https://github.com/AnaBoca/bootcamp-ruby-challenges/tree/master/quiz)
[*Heroku Hosted Application](https://quizone-ana-boca.herokuapp.com/)

### Quiz 1 Requirements: Web Development Pipeline
* This should be a rails application, not a plain HTML page.  
* The web application has a page with static content on it.  
* The web application is hosted on Heroku.  
* The code for the application is hosted on GitHub.  
* There is a headline on the page of the application that is a non-black color.  

### Quiz 2 Requirements: Setting up a Database
* Create a model, and database migration for something of your choosing.  
* Add the SimpleForm gem to your application.
* Build a new form for the item.
* Bonus (optional) When you press the submit button on the new form have it store the value in the database and show the item on the page.


## [ðŸ§® Quiz #3](https://github.com/AnaBoca/bootcamp-ruby-challenges/blob/master/vid_lessons/quizthree.rb)

### Quiz 3 Requirements: Object-Oriented Programming
Build a class for a Dog, Pony, Mountain, or any real world object you want to represent in code.  
* The class should take arguments when you build a new instance of it.
* The class should store the values that it is initialized with, in its instance variables.
* You should use attr_accessor.


## [ðŸ§® Image Blur #1](https://github.com/AnaBoca/bootcamp-ruby-challenges/blob/master/imageblur1_challenge.rb)

### Image Blur 1 Requirements
Build a class that allows us to build a new image with the data we specify. Make it possible for hte class to output the image to the screen. Your goal is to have the following code work:  
```ruby
image = Image.new([
  [0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 1, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 1],
  [0, 0, 0, 0]
])

image.output_image
```  
And when you run that code it will output the following to the terminal window:  

```ruby
0000
0100
0001
0000
```


## [ðŸ§® Image Blur #2 and #3](https://github.com/AnaBoca/bootcamp-ruby-challenges/blob/master/imageblur2_challenge/lib/image.rb)

### Image Blur 2 Requirements  
Given a black and white image, represented as the class you already implemented, implement a blur method to run a tranformation on the image. Running the blur transformation causes any 1 in the image to cause teh pixel to the left, right, and above and below to become a 1.

### Image Blur 3 Requirements  
Given an image, we want to build a method to blur the image. However, instead of only blurring images that are within 1 pixel, we want to specify how far to blur the pixels that are within a Manhattan Distance of what is specified. In the previous challenge we built a method that will produce the blurring with a Manhattan distance of 1. Build the method `def blur (distance)` that will implement a blurring of the Manhattan distance specified.  


## [ðŸ§® Linked List #1](https://github.com/AnaBoca/bootcamp-ruby-challenges/blob/master/linkedlist1_challenge.rb)

### Linked List 1 Requirements  
* Implement a Stack
* Reverse the LinkedList using iterative code


## [ðŸ§® Linked List #2](https://github.com/AnaBoca/bootcamp-ruby-challenges/blob/master/linkedlist2_challenge.rb)

### Linked List 2 Requirements  
* Reverse the LinkedList using mutation
* Build a method to determine if a LinkedList is infinite


## [ðŸ§® Luhn Algorithm](https://github.com/AnaBoca/bootcamp-ruby-challenges/tree/master/luhn_challenge)

### Luhn Algorithm Requirements
* Write a method to determine if a credit card number is valid
* Use the tests to make sure your solution is working


## [ðŸ§® Fibonacci Sequence](https://github.com/AnaBoca/bootcamp-ruby-challenges/blob/master/fibonacci_challenge.rb)

### Fibonacci Sequence Requirements
* Build a recursive method to find the nth digit
* Build an iterative method to find the nth digit
* Use the Benchmark module to test your solutions' performance
